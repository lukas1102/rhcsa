# basics in networking
- in ipv4 each node needs its own ip address, written in dotted decimal notation (192.168.0.1/24)
- each ip address must be inidcated with the subnet mask
- the default router or gateway specifies which server to forward packets to the outside world
- the DNS nameserver is the ip address of a server that helps resolving names to ip addresses
- ipv4 is most common IP, but ipv6 address can be used as well
- ipv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal notation (fd01::8eba:210)
- ipv4 and ipv6 can co-exist on the same network interface
